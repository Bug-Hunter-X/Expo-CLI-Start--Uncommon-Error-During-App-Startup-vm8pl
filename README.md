# Uncommon Expo CLI Error During App Startup

This repository demonstrates an uncommon error encountered when starting an Expo app using the Expo CLI's `start` command. The error is often vague, making debugging challenging. The primary issue is usually related to problems within the Metro bundler, the JavaScript bundler used by React Native applications built with Expo.

## Problem
The core issue is a lack of specificity in the error messages generated by the Expo CLI. Common problems might include incorrect dependencies, misconfigured build settings, or unexpected conflicts within the project's package.json or other configuration files.  Troubleshooting this error necessitates careful examination of the project's setup and a systematic approach to identify the root cause.

## Solution
The solution involves a combination of debugging techniques, such as verifying dependency versions, checking for conflicts in package.json, and examining the Metro bundler logs for more specific clues.  Careful attention to error logs generated by both the Expo CLI and the Metro bundler is crucial for pinpoint diagnosis.  Testing and iterating through these changes are also vital to ensure successful problem resolution.
