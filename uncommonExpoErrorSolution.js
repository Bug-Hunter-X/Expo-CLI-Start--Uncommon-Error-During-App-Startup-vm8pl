Debugging this error requires a systematic approach:

1. **Check Package.json:** Verify all dependencies are correctly specified and compatible. Look for conflicting versions or missing dependencies that might cause bundling errors. Use tools like `npm ls` or `yarn why` to investigate dependency trees.
2. **Examine Metro Bundler Logs:**  The Metro bundler usually provides more detailed error messages than the Expo CLI's initial output.  Find the Metro bundler logs (often found in your terminal output when running `expo start`), as they may contain more specific information about the root cause of the issue.
3. **Clean and Rebuild:** Try cleaning your project's cache and rebuilding. For npm: `npm cache clean --force && npm install`. For yarn: `yarn cache clean && yarn install`. Then, restart your app.
4. **Check for Configuration Errors:** Review your project's configuration files (like `app.json` or `babel.config.js`) to ensure they are properly set up and don't contain any typos or inconsistencies.
5. **Simplify:** Create a minimal reproduction of your app to isolate the issue. A minimal app helps determine if the error is related to a specific part of your code or a broader configuration problem. 
6. **Expo Diagnostics:** Run Expo's diagnostics tools (if available) to check for environment-specific problems.
7. **Search for Similar Issues:** Search online forums, GitHub issues, and Stack Overflow for similar errors.  Many of these vague errors have been encountered by other developers, and their solutions may help resolve yours.

Example improvements to package.json:
```javascript
{
  // ... other dependencies
  "react-native-web": "^0.18.10", // specify correct version
  // ... other dependencies
}
